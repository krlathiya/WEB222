	<p>Using HTML and CSS to resize a website so it looks good on any device such as a mobile phone, a desktop, or a tablet is known as responsive design. Basically, it's a user interface that can adjust smoothly on a variety of screen sizes. </p>
	<p>Web technologies that use responsive design have so many advantages. Mobile phones are now the main device through which people access websites today. Using responsive design, companies can create one website that works on all platforms rather than developing a platform-specific site. A company can create user-friendly websites since the users will not have to zoom in or out to perform operations, and the sites will load faster than those built on specific platforms. </p>
	<p>An interactive web application is simply a computer program built utilizing web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JS. The knowledge of those technologies is critical to creating an effective web application. Plan your design with users in mind. Frequently test it for bugs and errors when you're developing it. Building a web app requires great care when it comes to security, as it should protect your users' data. I think Angular JS or ASP.NET are good for building web apps. </p>
	<p>Throughout the WEB222 course, I learned about web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The course was not that much easy as I excepted but with the help of study material provided to me and some external research, I learned every concept of this course. The professor is also very helpful and clears all doubts and problems you have in mind. He is very responsive to mails and queries too. </p>
